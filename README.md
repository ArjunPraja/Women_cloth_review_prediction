# Women_cloth_review_prediction

This project is an example of using machine learning to predict whether a review for women's clothing is recommended or not, based on the review text. It uses a simple classification model called Multinomial Naive Bayes to make predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is "WomensClothingE_CommerceReviews.csv." It contains review data for women's clothing products. We specifically work with the "Review Text" as the feature and "Recommended IND" as the target variable.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `women_cloth_review_prediction.py` script to train the model and make predictions on the test set.

## Usage

Once you have set up the project and installed the required dependencies, you can run the `women_cloth_review_prediction.py` script. It will load the dataset, preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, vectorize the text data, train the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, and evaluate the model's performance.

The script will output the accuracy of the model on the test set and display a classification report and a confusion matrix.

## Customization

If you want to experiment with different models or features, you can modify the `women_cloth_review_prediction.py` script accordingly. You might also need to perform additional preprocessing steps on the data depending on your analysis.
